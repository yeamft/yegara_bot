# Bingo Blitz Live

Bingo Blitz Live is a mobile-first bingo web app designed for Telegram users. It combines a React/Vite frontend, Supabase-backed game and wallet logic, a Telegram bot, and an admin dashboard to run real-time 75-ball bingo rooms with public and private play modes.

## Main Routes

- `/game` - main game entry and lobby flow
- `/room/:code` - active room experience
- `/wallet` - wallet balances and requests
- `/history` - game/transaction history area
- `/profile` - player profile
- `/admin` - admin dashboard

## Architecture Notes

### 1. Frontend app

The frontend is a single-page application defined from `src/App.tsx` and optimized for mobile play. It uses a mock identity when Telegram WebApp context is unavailable, which makes local browser testing easier.

### 2. Supabase Edge Function game engine

Most game mutations are centralized in:

- `supabase/functions/game-action/index.ts`

This edge function handles actions such as:

- player registration
- room creation and joining
- lobby transitions
- calling bingo numbers
- marking numbers and auto-fill
- bingo claims and host verification
- wallet requests and admin actions

This keeps game state authoritative on the backend instead of trusting direct client writes.

### 3. Telegram integration

The app reads identity from `window.Telegram.WebApp` when running inside Telegram. Outside Telegram, it falls back to a locally generated mock identity stored in localStorage.

The companion bot in `bot/telegram-bot.js` can:

- register a player
- show balances
- create deposit requests
- send a button that opens the mini app

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- **Node.js** installed
- **npm** installed
- A **Supabase project**
- Optional: a **Telegram bot token** for bot testing

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run the Telegram bot

```bash
npm run bot
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Lint the codebase

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for Supabase and Telegram integration. Based on the codebase, you will likely need values similar to the following in your local environment:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
TELEGRAM_MINI_APP_URL=...
APP_URL=...
```

### Notes

- The Telegram bot reads `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `BOT_TOKEN`.
- The bot currently reads Supabase client values from `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- `TELEGRAM_MINI_APP_URL` is used to open the web app from Telegram.

## Supabase Setup

The repository contains:

- `supabase/config.toml`
- `supabase/migrations/`
- `supabase/functions/game-action/`

To work with Supabase locally or against your hosted project:

1. Create/link your Supabase project.
2. Apply the SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations`.
3. Deploy the `game-action` edge function.
4. Ensure your frontend environment variables point to the correct Supabase project.

If you use the Supabase CLI, typical commands are along the lines of:

```bash
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy game-action
```

Adjust these commands to match your local Supabase workflow.

## Telegram Bot Commands

The bot currently supports:

- `/start` - register and show quick actions
- `/register` - register account
- `/balance` - fetch wallet balances
- `/deposit <amount> <note>` - create a deposit request
- `/play` - open the mini app

## Admin Access

The admin page includes a test login flow for local/demo usage.

Current test credentials in the code:

- **Email:** `admin@test.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

The admin UI can also be enabled through test session logic used in `src/pages/Admin.tsx`.

## Deployment

### Frontend

The project includes a `vercel.json` rewrite so direct route visits resolve to `index.html` in production.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This makes the SPA work correctly when deployed to Vercel.

### Recommended deployment pieces

- Deploy the frontend to **Vercel** or another static host
- Deploy Supabase database migrations and the **game-action** edge function
- Host the Telegram bot separately as a long-running Node process if you want bot support

## Important Implementation Details

- Public rooms may automatically reuse an existing open room for the same stake.
- Players can join as watchers if they cannot stake in time or lack sufficient balance.
- Bingo claims are verified through a paused review phase before payout is finalized.
- Auto-fill can mark called numbers automatically for player cards.
- The app supports multilingual behavior, including Amharic speech playback for called numbers in room play.

## Scripts

Available npm scripts:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run build:dev
npm run preview
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run bot
```

## Known Development Notes

- The repository still contains a generic starter package name (`vite_react_shadcn_ts`) in `package.json`.
- The current `README.md` was originally a placeholder and has now been replaced with project-specific documentation.
- For full production readiness, make sure your actual environment variables, Supabase schema, and bot hosting setup are documented further for your team.

## Suggested Next Improvements

If you want to extend this README later, good additions would be:

- screenshots of the lobby, room, wallet, and admin pages
- a database schema overview
- a full environment variable reference
- deployment instructions for Supabase CLI and Telegram bot hosting
- contributor guidelines
